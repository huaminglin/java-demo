         * like those in DelayQueue and PriorityQueue, except that
         * every ScheduledFutureTask also records its index into the
         * heap array. This eliminates the need to find a task upon
         * cancellation, greatly speeding up removal (down from O(n)
         * to O(log n)), and reducing garbage retention that would
         * otherwise occur by waiting for the element to rise to top
         * before clearing. But because the queue may also hold
         * RunnableScheduledFutures that are not ScheduledFutureTasks,
         * we are not guaranteed to have such indices available, in
         * which case we fall back to linear search. (We expect that
         * most tasks will not be decorated, and that the faster cases
         * will be much more common.)
         *
         * All heap operations must record index changes -- mainly
         * within siftUp and siftDown. Upon removal, a task's
         * heapIndex is set to -1. Note that ScheduledFutureTasks can
         * appear at most once in the queue (this need not be true for
         * other kinds of tasks or work queues), so are uniquely
         * identified by heapIndex.
