# FutureDemo

Thread 1 (FutureTask.run()): FutureTask provides a run() for the consumer thread to execute;
Thread 2 (FutureTask.get()): The thread which calls FutureTask.get() is the producer thread.

## java.util.concurrent.FutureTask

```
    private volatile int state;
    private static final int NEW          = 0;
    private static final int COMPLETING   = 1;
    private static final int NORMAL       = 2;
    private static final int EXCEPTIONAL  = 3;
    private static final int CANCELLED    = 4;
    private static final int INTERRUPTING = 5;
    private static final int INTERRUPTED  = 6;

    /** The underlying callable; nulled out after running */
    private Callable<V> callable;
    /** The result to return or exception to throw from get() */
    private Object outcome; // non-volatile, protected by state reads/writes
    /** The thread running the callable; CASed during run() */
    private volatile Thread runner;
    /** Treiber stack of waiting threads */
    private volatile WaitNode waiters;
```

## java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.WaitNode

Simple linked list nodes to record waiting threads in a Treiber stack.
See other classes such as Phaser and SynchronousQueue for more detailed explanation.

```
    static final class WaitNode {
        volatile Thread thread;
        volatile WaitNode next;
        WaitNode() { thread = Thread.currentThread(); }
    }
```

## Removes and signals all waiting threads

```
    /**
     * Removes and signals all waiting threads, invokes done(), and
     * nulls out callable.
     */
    private void finishCompletion() {
        // assert state > COMPLETING;
        for (WaitNode q; (q = waiters) != null;) {
            if (WAITERS.weakCompareAndSet(this, q, null)) {
                for (;;) {
                    Thread t = q.thread;
                    if (t != null) {
                        q.thread = null;
                        LockSupport.unpark(t);
                    }
                    WaitNode next = q.next;
                    if (next == null)
                        break;
                    q.next = null; // unlink to help gc
                    q = next;
                }
                break;
            }
        }

        done();

        callable = null;        // to reduce footprint
    }
```

## java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run

```
    public void run() {
        if (state != NEW ||
            !RUNNER.compareAndSet(this, null, Thread.currentThread()))
            return;
        try {
            Callable<V> c = callable;
            if (c != null && state == NEW) {
                V result;
                boolean ran;
                try {
                    result = c.call();
                    ran = true;
                } catch (Throwable ex) {
                    result = null;
                    ran = false;
                    setException(ex);
                }
                if (ran)
                    set(result);
            }
        } finally {
            // runner must be non-null until state is settled to
            // prevent concurrent calls to run()
            runner = null;
            // state must be re-read after nulling runner to prevent
            // leaked interrupts
            int s = state;
            if (s >= INTERRUPTING)
                handlePossibleCancellationInterrupt(s);
        }
    }
```
