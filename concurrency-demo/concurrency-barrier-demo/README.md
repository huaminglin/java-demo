# CyclicBarrier Demo

## The count is 3, so the 4th await() goes into next generation

```
Thread 0 run()
Thread 1 run()
Thread 2 run()
main() exit
Thread 1 exit()
Thread 0 exit()
```

Note: the "Thread 2 exit()" is not printed. The 4th await() is blocked.


## dowait()

```
    /** The lock for guarding barrier entry */

    /** Condition to wait on until tripped */
    private final Condition trip = lock.newCondition();
    /** The number of parties */

    private Generation generation = new Generation();

    /**
     * Number of parties still waiting. Counts down from parties to 0
     * on each generation.  It is reset to parties on each new
     * generation or when broken.
     */
    private int count;

    private void nextGeneration() {
        // signal completion of last generation
        trip.signalAll();
        // set up next generation
        count = parties;
        generation = new Generation();
    }

    private int dowait(boolean timed, long nanos)
        throws InterruptedException, BrokenBarrierException,
               TimeoutException {
        final ReentrantLock lock = this.lock;
        lock.lock();
        try {
            final Generation g = generation;

            if (g.broken)
                throw new BrokenBarrierException();

                breakBarrier();
                throw new InterruptedException();
            }

            int index = --count;

                try {
                    final Runnable command = barrierCommand;
                    if (command != null)
                        command.run();
                    ranAction = true;
                    nextGeneration();
                    return 0;

                    if (!timed)
                        trip.await();
                    else if (nanos > 0L)
                        nanos = trip.awaitNanos(nanos);
                } catch (InterruptedException ie) {
                    if (g == generation && ! g.broken) {
                        breakBarrier();
                        throw ie;
                    } else {
                        // We're about to finish waiting even if we had not
                        // been interrupted, so this interrupt is deemed to
                        // "belong" to subsequent execution.
                        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                    }
                }

                if (g.broken)
                    throw new BrokenBarrierException();

                if (g != generation)
                    return index;

                if (timed && nanos <= 0L) {
                    breakBarrier();
                    throw new TimeoutException();
                }
            }
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
```

Note: "lock.lock();" and "trip.await()" is used. So the lock and condition is used to coordinate threads.

Note: It seems one "signalAll()" will awakes all the "trip.await()".
The awaken threads still need to wait for lock to continue, but no more signal is needed.
